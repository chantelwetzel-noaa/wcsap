The manage_file is a file containing management quantities
provided in a special pull by Rob Ames from the GMT016 table.
This special pull of all management quantities by species across years
had some issues that had to be fixed by hand:
Many rockfish species were missing "Rockfish" in their names and
I had to correct them by hand due to grep issues when only the first
name were used (e.g., China changed to China Rockfish).
The file does not contain OFLs or ACLs for sablefish, longspine
thornyhead, and shortspine thornyhead.
Quantities (OFLs,..) were duplicated for blue rockfish and rougheye/blackspotted
rockfish and had to be corrected by hand.
