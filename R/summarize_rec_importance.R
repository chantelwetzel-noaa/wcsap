#' Calculate recreational importance
#'
#' Summarize and format recreational catch data to be used along with recreational
#' importance scores to calculate the 'pseudo revenue' by species for the recreational fishery.
#' The function currently uses an existing csv file with previously calculated recreational
#' importance to access existing relative weights for each species and state. In the future
#' this should be modified in the future to use a stand-alone file containing the recreational
#' species weights by state that should be saved in the "data" folder.
#'
#' @param rec_catch R data object created by filter_gemm function with only recreational catches
#'   by state.
#' @param species R data object that contains a list of species names to calculate
#'   assessment prioritization.  The csv file with the list of species names should be
#'   stored in the data-raw folder ("species_names.csv")
#' @param rec_importance R data object with the species importance scoring by state.
#'   A CSV file with the state-specific species importance scores
#' @param assess_year R data object with the assessment year by species from the
#'   data-processed/assess_year_ssc_rec.csv.
#' @param last_assess_year Numeric value for the most recent assessment year.
